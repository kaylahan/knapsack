<h1>Branch and Bound for the 0/1 Knapsack Problem</h1>
<h3>Shalin Shah</h3>
<p>A Java implementation of the branch and bound algorithm for the 0/1 knapsack problem. The code uses Lagrangian relaxation to prune the search tree. It uses best first search.</p>
<p>A sample instance of 5000 items is included. This instance has the weights in weights.txt and values (profits) in values.txt. The file solution.txt contains some information about the problem instance.</p>
<pre>Change the following in Constants.java to the files that contain the weights and values respectively.
DATA_FILE_WEIGHTS
DATA_FILE_VALUES
DELIMITER
<br>
Change the following in Constants.java to instance specific information.
MAX_WEIGHT
NUMBER_OBJECTS</pre>
